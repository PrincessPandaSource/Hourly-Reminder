# Hourly Reminder
Hourly Reminder is a quick, little Python program I wrote that automatically sends notifications for each new hour, complete with a different icon and sound each time. It is intended to be similar to a cuckoo clock. I created it as an aid for ADHD, one of its major symptoms being time blindness, so I could be reminded of time passing and be more productive as the result.

It is Windows-only for now.
